      "The Music Prodigy App was perpetually in a state of \"MVP\" (Minimum Viable Product), which led to many User Experience challenges, since each new feature was simply tacked on without considering the overall experience. I was brought in by the company to assist with rethinking the user flow for the app and help with development as well as new features and products.",
      "As a differentiator between my work and many people who consider themselves \"user experience designers,\" is that I approach the project from the ground up. User research, personas and identifying user flows, tasks and needs are the place to start. From there, when you get a user flow like this, expect annotations for ISO standards, clear instructions and definitions of tasks. Only then can you get into a wireframe.",
      "An advantage I have over many UX designers is that I can also quickly prototype in code, and not just garbage code, but JavaScript that can then be reused in the final application."

This makes updating disclosures on all marketing landing pages simple. Due to technology constraints, all disclosures must be saved in an XML file, accessed with AJAX by special javascript files on each landing page.",
      "Managers build the javascript files within the Disclaiminator tool by selecting the disclosures they need for their campaign, disclosure variables and campaign variables. The tool then outputs a javascript file to be embedded in the landing page as well as a JSON file—which can be uploaded to the Disclaiminator tool to load all variables into the application for modification—and a Word Document for review.",
